## BOB Story  
### Intro : 
<pre>
This is Bob.  

Bob is a developer. Bobâ€™s team is *why HR exists.*  

### Bob's Nightmare :  
- Alice â€“ Treats UI design like therapy. *"Does this dropdown *spark joy*?"*  
- Dave â€“ Codes like heâ€™s being chased. *"Works fine!"* (*Server is on fire*)  
- Carol â€“  found bugs in the README file . *sometimes in text files*  
- Eve â€“ scheduled a pre-meeting for the planning meeting.. *"This couldâ€™ve been an emailâ€¦ but here we are."*  

</pre>
### Bob's Idea :
<pre>
### Bobâ€™s 3 AM Despair (With Bonus Existential Dread):  
*"What ifâ€¦ there was a tool that couldâ€¦"*  

ðŸ”¹ Tame Aliceâ€™s *Creative Flow*  
â†’ *Auto-lock designs* after 2 revisions (*"Pick one. Cry later."*)  
â†’ *Ban* the phrase *"What if weâ€¦"* after 6 PM  

ðŸ”¹ Keep Dave *Honest*  
â†’ *Force* his *"works fine"* code to run *on Carolâ€™s laptop first*  
â†’ *Public shame* when his commits break *literally anything*  

ðŸ”¹ Give Carol *An Outlet*  
â†’ *Convert* her *README.md*  into *actual tickets*  

ðŸ”¹ Stop Eveâ€™s *Meeting Addiction*  
â†’ *Require* a *written oath* that a meeting is *truly needed*  
â†’ *Auto-decline* any invite titled *"Quick sync"*
