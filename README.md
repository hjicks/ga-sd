# what is this
these are files for our presention of _software development_ class.

# what can i do with these?
dunno. you can build the presention if you'd like:
```
$ make setup
$ make
```
this install required libraries and generates outputs at `out/html/index.html`

for whole file, you can run the following:
```
$ make html
```
which generates the 100+ pages html file.
