# Welcome To GitHub issue 

## Introduction : 
<p>
    This guide demonstrates how to use GitHub Issues to plan and track a piece of work. In this guide, you will create a new issue and add a task list to track sub-tasks. You'll also learn how to add labels, milestones, assignees, and projects to communicate metadata about your issue.
</p>


## Opening a blank issue
<p>
    First, create an issue. There are multiple ways to create an issue; you can choose the most convenient method for your workflow. This example will use the GitHub UI. For more information about other ways to create an issue, see Creating an issue.
</p>



1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2. Under your repository name, click
Issues.

![github issue](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-51267/mw-1440/images/help/repository/repo-tabs-issues-global-nav-update.webp)

3. Click New issue.

## Filling in information
<p>
    Add a description that explains the purpose of the issue, including any details that might help resolve the issue. For example, if this is a bug report, describe the steps to reproduce the bug, the expected result, and the actual result.
</p>

<p>
    You can use markdown to add formatting, links, emojis, and more. For more information, see Writing on GitHub.
</p>


## Adding a task list 
<p>
    It can be helpful to break large issues into smaller tasks, or to track multiple related issues in a single larger issue. Add a task list to your issue by prefacing list items with [ ]. Reference existing issues by issue number or URL. You can use plain text to track tasks that don't have a corresponding issue and convert them to issues later. For more information, see About task lists.

## Adding labels

<p>
    Add a label to categorize your issue. For example, you might use a bug label and a good first issue label to indicate that an issue is a bug that a first-time contributor could pick up. Users can filter issues by label to find all issues that have a specific label.
</p>

## Adding milestones 
<p>
    You can add a milestone to track the issue as part of a date based target. A milestone will show the progress of the issues as the target date approaches. For more information, see About milestones.
</p>

## Assigning the issue

<p>
    To communicate responsibility, you can assign the issue to a member of your organization. For more information, see Assigning issues and pull requests to other GitHub users.
</p>

## Adding the issue to a project

<p>
    You can add the issue to an existing project and populate metadata for the project. For more information about projects, see About Projects.
</p>
