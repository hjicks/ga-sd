# Intro
## Story time
once upon a time, there was a software company in redmond,
they had monopolized the market, had the most talented programmers
and had the endless amount of money.

they just had made a succesful release,
perhaps the most successful software to the date.
next step was aiming for much higher, making their software more roubst, faster and easier to maintain:
* using object oriented and memory safe languages
* modern built-in database based file systems
* enhanced security and graphics

not all is good however.
they missed their first deadline from 2002,
then once again in 2004, 2005 and 2006.

the company was microsoft, the software was windows vista.

what gone wrong?

## Success story
