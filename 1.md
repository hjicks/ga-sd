collaboration is the key to team work.
for smaller teams, this consists of a feedback loop.

for bigger projects however, creating that loop is exteremly hard,
huge projects these days have tight sequules, short deadlines, hard requirements and lots of work.

for example, linux kernel had a average commit per day of ~250 during recent years,
as another example, chromium browser engine had a average of ~300 commits per day in the 2024 year, growing to ~330 in first quater of 2025.

this begs the question, how could they collabrate effecitvely in such a workflow, with lots of contributers, changes and challenges?

answer is tools and methodology, these go hand in hand.
in this, and next few presentions we focus on tools that make that possible,
namely issue trackers, version control software and devops tools.
