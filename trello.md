## What is a board? 
**A board represents a place to keep track of information** — often for large projects, teams, or workflows. Whether you are launching a new website, tracking sales, or planning your next office party, a Trello board is the place to organize tasks, all the little details, and most importantly—collaborate with your colleagues.

## What is a list?

**Lists keep cards , or specific tasks or pieces of information**, organized in their various stages of progress. Lists can be used to create a workflow where cards are moved across each step in the process from start to finish, or simply act as a place to keep track of ideas and information. There’s no limit to the number of lists you can add to a board, and they can be arranged and titled however you’d like.

## What is a card?

**The smallest, but most detailed unit of a board is a card** . Cards are used to represent tasks and ideas. A card can be something that needs to get done, like a blog post to be written, or something that needs to be remembered

## What is the board menu?

**On the right side of your Trello board is the menu the mission control center for your board**.
The menu is where you manage members' board permissions, control settings, search cards, enable Power-Ups, and create automations. You can also see all of the activity that has taken place on a board in the menu’s activity feed. Take some time to check out everything the menu has to offer.
