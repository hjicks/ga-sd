# section 1

## What is a board? 
**A board represents a place to keep track of information** ‚Äî often for large projects, teams, or workflows. Whether you are launching a new website, tracking sales, or planning your next office party, a Trello board is the place to organize tasks, all the little details, and most importantly‚Äîcollaborate with your colleagues.

![trello board image](https://images.ctfassets.net/rz1oowkt5gyp/1QO6vATRbsVLw9Laka8cnB/31084f6152bdcf4984678a4eacf476c4/ch1_01.png?w=1920&fm=webp)


## What is a list?

**Lists keep cards , or specific tasks or pieces of information**, organized in their various stages of progress. Lists can be used to create a workflow where cards are moved across each step in the process from start to finish, or simply act as a place to keep track of ideas and information. There‚Äôs no limit to the number of lists you can add to a board, and they can be arranged and titled however you‚Äôd like.

![trello list iamge](https://images.ctfassets.net/rz1oowkt5gyp/6Nh5Ot7Pq2lcmJ5MSokFMd/2fa337c1376b4bb81065aea8b432708b/ch1_02.png?w=1280&fm=webp)

## What is a card?

**The smallest, but most detailed unit of a board is a card** . Cards are used to represent tasks and ideas. A card can be something that needs to get done, like a blog post to be written, or something that needs to be remembered

![trello card image](https://images.ctfassets.net/rz1oowkt5gyp/2n5X1Myf2Kpp5eQaVmRqr8/8fe3faea8345de8a2e0acca8871b08f1/ch1_03__1_.png?w=1920&fm=webp)

## What is the board menu?

**On the right side of your Trello board is the menu the mission control center for your board**.
The menu is where you manage members' board permissions, control settings, search cards, enable Power-Ups, and create automations. You can also see all of the activity that has taken place on a board in the menu‚Äôs activity feed. Take some time to check out everything the menu has to offer.

![trello menu image](https://images.ctfassets.net/rz1oowkt5gyp/4BSwU9OXElIA0ADMu3Yiwr/3deb2a26d6a874f33ac822cf02e6a24b/ch1_04.png?w=1920&fm=webp)

# section 2
#  Build your project in Trello 

## Create a board
- From the team‚Äôs Workspace tab, click ‚ÄúCreate new board‚Äù or click the plus button (+) in the Trello header directly to the left of your name, and select ‚ÄúCreate Board‚Äù.

- Name the board to represent whatever you are working on, from organizing an event or managing a blog, to tracking sales leads or launching a new product

![trello create board image](./assets/trello_images/createBoard.png)


**Your project data and information are your most valuable assets. As you work through creating a new Trello board, you will have options for adjusting your privacy settings.**


- When you are creating a board, the default setting is **‚ÄòWorkspace Visible‚Äô** which means any members of that Workspace can view, join, and edit cards.

- If you change your settings to **Private**, only members of that specific board can see it. Typically, you want to default to Private if you are working on a more restrictive project and do not want other team members to access it. It is great for 1:1 boards, personal to do's boards or boards shared with customers.

- **Public** boards allow anyone with the link to the board to see it. Public boards are ranked on search engines such as Google, meaning that any information on this specific board will be accessible to anyone on the internet. This setting can be used for a public project or for product roadmap that is open to public feedback. Just like other board settings, you can granularly choose who can comment, add or remove members, and edit and join the board

## Customize your board

No two workflows are alike, so why not give each board a unique look and feel? In the spirit of fun and flexibility, we let you customize your board background to reflect your team‚Äôs unique personality.
