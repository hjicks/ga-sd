# Story time
Once upon a time, there was a software company
they had monopolized the market, had the most talented programmers
and had the endless amount of money.

they just had made a succesful release,
perhaps the most successful software to the date.


# Story time
They were so confident, and have set the following goals for
their next release:

- using object oriented and memory safe languages
- modern built-in database based file systems
- enhanced security and graphics
- and a lot more features

# Story time
Not all gone well however
they missed their first deadline from 2002,
then once again in 2004, 2005 and 2006.

the company was microsoft, the software was windows vista.
