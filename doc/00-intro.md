# Story time
Once upon a time, there was a software company
they had monopolized the market, had the most talented programmers
and had the endless amount of money.

they just had made a succesful release,
perhaps the most successful software to the date.

# Story time
They were so confident, and have set the following goals for
their next release:

- using object oriented and memory safe languages
- modern built-in database based file systems
- enhanced security and graphics
- and a lot more features

# Story time
Not all gone well however.
they missed their first deadline from 2002,
then once again in 2004, 2005 and 2006.

It cost 120 billion dollars. ([source](https://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-Vista-the-120-Billion-Operating-System-54843.shtml))

The company was **microsoft**, and the software was **Windows vista**.

what gone wrong?

# What are project management tools?

**issue tracking** and **collaboration**.
to achieve this, serval management tools were made,
