# Story time


Once upon a time, there was a software company that had monopolized the market,
had the most talented programmers and an endless amount of money and resources

they had just the most successful release,
perhaps the most successful software to date

# Story time
they were pretty confident,
and had set the following goals for their next release

- using OO or and memory safe languages
- modern built-in database based file systems
- enhanced security and graphics
- and many more features

# Story time
Not all went well however

They **missed** their first deadline for release in **2002**,
then twice again again in 2004 and 2005, finally releasing in **2006**

===

**4 years wasted**

Constant delays cost them **120 billion dollars** ([source](https://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-Vista-the-120-Billion-Operating-System-54843.shtml))

Larger projects often need **planning**, **resource management**,
**issue tracking** and **collaboration**.
to achieve this, project management tools were made.

- They can reduce the amount of ***time***, ***budget*** and ***work*** spent on a project
- They can improve ***collaboration*** between teams
- They enhance ***communications*** between developers and end-users
