# Story time

Once upon a time, there was a software company
they had monopolized the market, had the most talented programmers
and had the endless amount of money.

They just had made a successful release,
perhaps the most successful software to the date.

# Story time
They were so confident, and have set the following goals for
their next release:

- using object oriented and memory safe languages
- modern built-in database based file systems
- enhanced security and graphics
- and a lot more features

# Story time
Not all gone well however

They **missed** their first deadline from **2002**,
then once again in 2004 and **2006**

===

**4 years wasted**

It cost them **120 billion dollars** ([source](https://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-Vista-the-120-Billion-Operating-System-54843.shtml))

Larger projects often need **planning**, **resource management**,
**issue tracking** and **collaboration**.
to achieve this, project management tools were made.
