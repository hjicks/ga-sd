## Fundamentals ideas
**A board represents a place to keep track of information**,

- a Trello board is the place to organize tasks, all the little details, and most importantly *collaborate* with your colleagues.

**Lists keep cards**,

- organized in their various stages of progress. Lists can be used to create workflow where cards are moved as they progressed or to keep ideas and information.
- Thereâ€™s no limit to the number of lists
- They can be arranged and titled however youâ€™d like.

**The smallest and most detailed unit is a card**,

- Cards are used to represent tasks and ideas. A card can be something that needs to get done.

## What is the board menu?

**On the right side of your Trello board is the menu the mission control center for your board**.

The menu is where you manage members' **board permissions**, **control settings**, **search cards**, **enable Power-Ups**, and **create automations**.

You can also see all of the activity that has taken place on a board in the menuâ€™s activity feed. Take some time to check out everything the menu has to offer.
