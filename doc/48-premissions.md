### Setting board permissions

- If a board is Workspace visible it means any members of that Workspace can view, join, and edit cards.
    
- If a board is Private, only members of that specific board can view the board and join and edit cards.
    
- If a board is Public, anyone with the link to the board can view the board, but only members of the board can edit cards. Note: These boards are indexed by search engines and are publicly visible on the internet.
