# Questions

1. What are lists in Trello?  <!-- refers to 41-intro.md -->
2. Name some project manager tools. <!--referes to 10-history.md -->
3. What makes Jira ideal for enterprise engineering teams? <!-- refers to 22-features-jira.md --->
4. Which tools offer native code integration besides Jira? <!--refers to 30-compersion.md --> 
<!-- answer 4 : 
"Which tools offer native code integration besides Jira?"
✅ GitHub & GitLab – Both provide native code + issue tracking in one platform (e.g., GitHub’s built-in editor, GitLab’s web IDE).
❌ Trello – No native integration; relies on Power-Ups for basic repo links.
🔗 Jira – Deep links to repos (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) but isn’t "native."
-->
5. Name some benefits of project management tools.

These are available in [github](https://github.com/hjicks/ga-sd/issues/6) too ;)
