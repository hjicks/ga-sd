<!-- answer 4 : 
1. "Which tools offer native code integration besides Jira?"

✅ GitHub & GitLab – Both provide native code + issue tracking in one platform (e.g., GitHub’s built-in editor, GitLab’s web IDE).
❌ Trello – No native integration; relies on Power-Ups for basic repo links.
🔗 Jira – Deep links to repos (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) but isn’t "native."
